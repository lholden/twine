* Twine

A light-weight forking library.

While there are many other libraries available to handle forking, most of them 
seem to be either very specific, or want to include way too much. 

Twine on the other hand is intended to be light weight and easy to use. 
Inspired by Fibers and Threads, a Twine for producing 'heavy weight' (forked 
/ multi-process) parallelism.

Twine is still in very early stages, you have been warned.

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  # Background a process
  Twine.daemonize {:output_to => '/tmp/my.log'}
  puts "This is now a backgrounded 'daemon' process"
  sleep 10
#+END_SRC

NOTE: Examples of Child processes, pooling, and IPC to come.
